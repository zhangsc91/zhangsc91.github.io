Create a new post straight from github.com. 

Don't forget the header! 

"--- layout: post, title: [insert title] ---"

Also don't forget ".md" extension!

## Header 2
* bullet 1
* bullet 2
  * Remember to add space after "*", "+" or "-"!
  - On the other hand, it is safe to use "-", "+" and "*", as long as there's no space directly after them?
  + Minus sign doesn't like quotation mark..

## Header 3
$$\exp(-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2})$$ is the normal distribution (unnormalized).

Now I can turn on comments by adding "comments: true" to the front matter!
