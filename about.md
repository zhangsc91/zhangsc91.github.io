I am a Math PhD candidate at Stanford University. I started this blog to write about things I learn and think about outside pure math. Expect to see technical non-math, or non-technical math posts!

### More Information

I am also known as Sicong Zhang, or 张思聪.

I study symplectic topology; in particular, I count the number of gradient descents, and use them to extract features that are robust under random noise. People in my lab will get the joke, including this sentence.

Back in undergrad I took many physics courses. I was not a physics major only because I didn't take the lab courses.

Right now I am taking CS 229 machine learning class. I am happy to learn applied/engineering/real stuff!

Together with a team of friends, I translate educational math videos [(3Blue1Brown)](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) into [Chinese](https://space.bilibili.com/88461692). We have close to 0.5M subscribers!

What's in season at Stanford: lemons, oranges and loquats.
