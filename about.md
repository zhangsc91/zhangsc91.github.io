I am a Math PhD candidate at Stanford University. I started this blog to write about things I learn and think about outside pure math. Expect to see technical non-math, or non-technical math posts!

### More Information

You might also know me as Sicong Zhang, or 张思聪.

Together with a team of friends, I translate educational math videos [(3Blue1Brown)](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) into [Chinese](https://space.bilibili.com/88461692). We have close to 0.5M subscribers!
